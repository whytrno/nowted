Why do we say that? Well, you will agree that writing is an art form. It requires someone to logically and meticulously put together thoughts into a coherent, readable format. But why is it a science? Because every piece of writing needs to have a structure. It must present a point of view in a well-framed, grammatically correct manner. The best content comes from a great mix of these two traits. Organizations use data to analyze customer behavior. They study what their customers are searching for and what kind of content they are likely to consume. Then, this insightful data is used to plan and create relevant and meaningful content for their customers. While science defines what needs to be written, it is the art and craft of writing that helps create highly readable and engaging content."
